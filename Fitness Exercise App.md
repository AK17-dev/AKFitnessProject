# Fitness Exercise App

A simple, single-page Flutter application that displays a list of fitness exercises with a clean and modern user interface. This project is designed to demonstrate a basic Flutter UI with static data, suitable for beginners or as a starting point for a more complex fitness app.

## Features

- **Single Page Design**: The entire app is contained within a single screen, with no navigation or routing.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with rounded cards, shadows, and a pleasant color scheme.
- **Static Data**: All exercise data is stored locally in a `List`, making it easy to understand and modify.
- **Scrollable List**: Uses `ListView.builder` for an efficient and scrollable list of exercises.
- **Responsive Layout**: The UI is designed to work well on various screen sizes.
- **Well-Commented Code**: The `main.dart` file is thoroughly commented to explain the structure and logic, making it easy for beginners to follow.
